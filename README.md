# Mitch's Portfolio Website

I wanted to learn more about Next JS, Typescript, Framer Motion and Tailwind and so I used my portfolio website as an opportunity to do this. The website was originally inspired by a YouTube video by Sonny Sangha, and over time has morphed into something I am quite proud of. The portfolio uses Sanity as backend, so that it can update the information without rebuilding the application.

Want to see it in action? You can find the website [here](https://mitchellsparrow.com)!

# Next JS:

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Running the code

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

# Vercel:

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

# Sanity:

To just run sanity:

```
cd sanity
sanity start
```

To deploy sanity:

```
sanity deploy
```
